# checkmate_tcp_echo (Resource)

TCP Echo

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "checkmate_tcp_echo" "example" {
  # The hostname where the echo request will be sent
  host = "foo.bar"

  # The TCP port at which the request will be sent
  port = 3002

  # Message that will be sent to the TCP echo server
  message = "PROXY tcpbin.com:4242 foobartest"

  # Message expected to be present in the echo response
  expected_message = "foobartest"

  # Set the connection timeout for the destination host, in milliseconds
  connection_timeout = 3000

  # Set the per try timeout for the destination host, in milliseconds
  single_attempt_timeout = 2000

  # Set a number of consecutive sucesses to make the check pass
  consecutive_successes = 5
}

# In case you expect to be some kind of problem, and not getting
# a response back, you can set `expect_failure` to true. In that case
# you can skip `expected_message`.
resource "checkmate_tcp_echo" "example" {
  # The hostname where the echo request will be sent
  host = "foo.bar"

  # The TCP port at which the request will be sent
  port = 3002

  # Message that will be sent to the TCP echo server
  message = "PROXY nonexistent.local:4242 foobartest"

  # Expect this to fail
  expect_write_failure = true

  # Set the connection timeout for the destination host, in milliseconds
  connection_timeout = 3000

  # Set the per try timeout for the destination host, in milliseconds
  single_attempt_timeout = 2000

  # Set a number of consecutive sucesses to make the check pass
  consecutive_successes = 5
}

## Schema

### Required

- `host` (String) The hostname where to send the TCP echo request to
- `message` (String) The message to send in the echo request
- `port` (Number) The port of the hostname where to send the TCP echo request

### Optional

- `connection_timeout` (Number) The timeout for stablishing a new TCP connection in milliseconds
- `consecutive_successes` (Number) Number of consecutive successes required before the check is considered successful overall. Defaults to 1.
- `create_anyway_on_check_failure` (Boolean) If false, the resource will fail to create if the check does not pass. If true, the resource will be created anyway. Defaults to false.
- `expect_write_failure` (Boolean) Wether or not the check is expected to fail after successfully connecting to the target. If true, the check will be considered successful if it fails. Defaults to false.
- `expected_message` (String) The message expected to be included in the echo response
- `interval` (Number) Interval in milliseconds between attemps. Default 200
- `keepers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of string values that when changed will cause the check to run again.
- `single_attempt_timeout` (Number) Timeout for an individual attempt. If exceeded, the attempt will be considered failure and potentially retried. Default 5000ms
- `timeout` (Number) Overall timeout in milliseconds for the check before giving up, default 10000

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Identifier
- `passed` (Boolean) True if the check passed
