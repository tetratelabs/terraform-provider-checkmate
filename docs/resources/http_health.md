# checkmate_http_health (Resource)

HTTPS Healthcheck

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "checkmate_http_health" "example" {
  # This is the url of the endpoint we want to check
  url = "http://example.com"

  # Will perform an HTTP GET request
  method = "GET"

  # The overall test should not take longer than 10 seconds
  timeout = 10000

  # Wait 0.1 seconds between attempts
  interval = 100

  # Expect a status 200 OK
  status_code = 200

  # We want 2 successes in a row
  consecutive_successes = 2

  # Send these HTTP headers
  headers = {
    "Example-Header" = "example value"
  }
}

resource "checkmate_http_health" "example_ca_bundle" {
  url                   = "https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/"
  method                = "GET"
  interval              = 1
  status_code           = 200
  consecutive_successes = 2
  ca_bundle             = file("badssl-root.cert.cer")
}

resource "checkmate_http_health" "example_no_ca_bundle" {
  url                   = "https://httpbin.org/status/200"
  request_timeout       = 1000
  method                = "GET"
  interval              = 1
  status_code           = 200
  consecutive_successes = 2
}

resource "checkmate_http_health" "example_insecure_tls" {
  url                   = "https://self-signed.badssl.com/"
  request_timeout       = 1000
  method                = "GET"
  interval              = 1
  status_code           = 200

- `url` (String) URL

### Optional

- `ca_bundle` (String) The CA bundle to use when connecting to the target host.
- `consecutive_successes` (Number) Number of consecutive successes required before the check is considered successful overall. Defaults to 1.
- `create_anyway_on_check_failure` (Boolean) If false, the resource will fail to create if the check does not pass. If true, the resource will be created anyway. Defaults to false.
- `headers` (Map of String) HTTP Request Headers

- `interval` (Number) Interval in milliseconds between attemps. Default 200
- `keepers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of string values that when changed will cause the healthcheck to run again.
- `method` (String) HTTP Method, defaults to GET
- `request_body` (String) Optional request body to send on each attempt.
- `request_timeout` (Number) Timeout for an individual request. If exceeded, the attempt will be considered failure and potentially retried. Default 1000
- `status_code` (String) Status Code to expect. Can be a comma seperated list of ranges like '100-200,500'. Default 200
- `timeout` (Number) Overall timeout in milliseconds for the check before giving up. Default 5000
